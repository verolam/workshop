## APP Versions - Your Versions
This is where can keep track of YOUR OWN VERSIONS.<br>
Create a folder *for each version of the app* so you can better see your progress.<br>

A good way to name the folders is something like this:<br>

```js
//(the version and what concept you learned)
"Version01-Static"
"Version02-PHP"
"..."

//or
"v01-Static"
"v02-PHP"
"..."

//or simply this if you keep trak of the course subjects on your notebook
"v01"
"v02"
"..."
```

If you want, you can use this README file to put your personal notes.
