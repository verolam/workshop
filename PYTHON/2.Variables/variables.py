# VARIABLES
# ====================================
# Python is a "type-inferred" language
#you don't have to explicity define the variable type

# Declare and asign value 

website = "apple.com"
# print(website)

website = "powercoders.com"
# print(website)

# Assigning multiple values to multiple varaibles
a, b, c = 5, 3.5, "*hello!"
print(b)



# Assign the same value for multiple variables

a = b = c = 8
